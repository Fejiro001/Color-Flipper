# Color-Flipper

This is the first project from the [Build 15 JavaScript Projects - Vanilla JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=363s).

A website that changes the background color of the body and generates its HEX color code when the button is clicked.
There is a page for Simple version where we gave the website the colors, while the Hex version looped through and appended numbers and letters to create a HEX color.
